## Introduction

As part of helping to draft a new policy we need to consider areas within 400m of secondary schools. Buffers have previously been used for such measurements i.e. as-the-crow-flies. However, for the draft policy a more accurate measurement would be a 400m walk and using isochrones. Strictly speaking a 400m distance from a school is an isodistance and a 5 minute walk is an isochrone, but the term isochrone is generally used to cover both distance and time from a point. The diagrams below illustrate the difference between a buffer and an isochrone:

<img src="Images/isochrone.png" title="irregular polygon" alt="Isochrone" width="300"/>

The purpose of these notes is to understand:

1.  The best network dataset/service and software to use to create the isochrones.

2.  How to define the school points e.g. the main school entrance?

The best network dataset/service and software to use will be looked at in descending order of convenience i.e. those further down the list require more effort:

-   AGOL logistic service and ArcGIS Pro

-   openrouteservice and R

-   OS MasterMap Highways Network and Portal

-   OS MasterMap Highways Network and ArcGIS Pro

The resulting isochrones will be included in the [Portal App](https://sheffieldcitycouncil.cloud.esriuk.com/portal/apps/View/index.html?appid=ba3cbfdb0c3642c6bfe48500b11473e9) (requires a license and login credentials), which was created to help draft the policy.

## Secondary schools

The first thing to do is get the secondary school features we want to create isocrones for. I've made some [notes about the Council's GIS](https://scc-pi.github.io/notes/gis.html#gis), and more specifically about the [R-ArcGIS Bridge](https://scc-pi.github.io/notes/gis.html#r-arcgis-bridge) that is used below to get the data from the Council's web GIS.

```{r school-features}
# URL for secondary schools from the Council's Portal (without a token!)
secondary_schools_url  <- str_c("https://sheffieldcitycouncil.cloud.esriuk.com",
                               "/server/rest/services/AGOL/Education/FeatureServer/3")

# Get secondary schools as simple features with WSG84 coordinates
sf_secondary_schools <- arc.open(secondary_schools_url) %>% 
  arc.select() %>% 
  arc.data2sf() %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

# URL for the city boundary from the Council's AGOL Open Data
city_boundary_url  <- str_c("https://utility.arcgis.com/usrsvcs/servers/",
                            "4cdfd020c6f54581a3065c734535adab/rest/services/",
                            "AGOL/OpenData/MapServer/11")

# Get the city boundary as a simple feature with WSG84 coordinates 
sf_city <- arc.open(city_boundary_url) %>% 
  arc.select() %>% 
  arc.data2sf() %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

# Get the bounding box (coordinates) for Sheffield
shef_bbox <- st_buffer(sf_city, 1000) %>% 
  st_bbox() %>%
  as.numeric()

# Get a basemap
basemap <- get_map(location = shef_bbox, 
                   zoom = 11, 
                   maptype = 'terrain-background', 
                   source = 'stamen')

# Plot
ggmap(basemap, legend = "left") +
  geom_sf(data = sf_secondary_schools, mapping = aes(),
          colour = "blue", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data = sf_city, mapping = aes(), 
          fill = NA, colour = "black", size = 1, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Sheffield Secondary Schools") +
  theme_void()
```

## AGOL logistic service & ArcGIS Pro

*TODO: get isochrones from Portal and note from Word document*

## openrouteservice & R

The [openrouteservice R client package](https://giscience.github.io/openrouteservice-r/index.html) provides easy access to the [openrouteservice](https://openrouteservice.org/) (ORS) API from R.

## OSMM Highways Network & Portal

*TODO: get OneNote isochrone notes*

## OSMM Highways Network & ArcGIS Pro

## Other options

*TODO: see takeaway bookmarks and in particular the Lovelace paper*

# Appendix

## ToDo

-   Left column navigation (try [includes: in_header:](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html#Figure_Options))

-   Separate documents

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Unlike the [Notes](https://scc-pi.github.io/notes/) site, the bulk of the rendering is done locally rather than via GitHub Actions. To some extent this is simpler, and it also works around where rendering needs to reference a local licensed installation of ArcGIS desktop. The site is setup as per the basic [GitHub Pages guidance](https://guides.github.com/features/pages). The rendering that isn't local uses a [Jekyll theme](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).
