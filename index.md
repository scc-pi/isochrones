## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Unlike the [Notes](https://scc-pi.github.io/notes/) site, the bulk of
the rendering is done locally rather than via GitHub Actions. To some
extent this is simpler, and it also works around where rendering needing
to reference a local licensed installation of ArcGIS desktop.

The site is setup as per the basic [GitHub Pages
guidance](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/#setup). The
rendering that isn’t local is via a [Jekyll
theme](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).
